[This repository](https://github.com/bummercloud/tjstein.com) holds the source code and configuration for my personal website.

The site is powered by Jekyll and built on mostly valid HTML5 and CSS3. Posts are in markdown.

The only plugin I use currently is for pagination so you'll need the jekyll-pagination (0.0.3) gem.

<pre>gem install jekyll-pagination</pre>
